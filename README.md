# ✅ Bank Marketing Decision Tree Classifier

This project is part of my **Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech**.  
The objective was to build a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit, using their demographic and behavioral data.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

In this task, I developed a **Decision Tree Classifier** using the [Bank Marketing dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal was to model customer decision behavior in direct marketing campaigns.

## 📂 Dataset Information

- **File Used**: `bank-additional.csv`
- **Rows**: 4119
- **Target Variable**: `deposit` (formerly `y`)
- **Problem Type**: Binary classification (yes/no)

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data Manipulation
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – Data Visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Model Building & Evaluation

## 🔍 Key Tasks Performed

- ✅ Data loading, renaming columns, basic inspection
- ✅ Handling missing data and duplicates
- ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- ✅ Outlier detection and removal (IQR method)
- ✅ Label Encoding of categorical features
- ✅ Correlation matrix for feature selection
- ✅ Splitting into training and test sets
- ✅ Training Decision Tree Classifiers (Gini and Entropy)
- ✅ Model evaluation using confusion matrix, accuracy, classification report
- ✅ Tree visualization for model interpretability

## 📊 Visualizations

- Categorical bar plots  
- Numeric histograms & box plots  
- Correlation heatmap  
- Decision tree diagrams

## 📈 Model Summary

### Gini Criterion Decision Tree:
- `max_depth=5`, `min_samples_split=10`  
- Well-balanced performance on training and test data

### Entropy Criterion Decision Tree:
- `max_depth=4`, `min_samples_split=15`  
- Clean and interpretable splits

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Try advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Deploy model using Streamlit or Flask
